# 📝 GoPwnIt Writeups Policy

### Guidelines for publishing and sharing CTF writeups responsibly

</div>

---

## 🔍 Introduction

This document defines the **official policy for writing, publishing, and sharing CTF writeups** related to challenges hosted on **GoPwnIt**.

Writeups are encouraged for learning purposes, but **must never compromise the fairness** of active or upcoming CTF events.

---

## 📌 What is a Writeup?

A writeup is a documented explanation of:
- How a challenge was approached  
- Tools and techniques used  
- Reasoning behind each step  
- Lessons learned  

Writeups should focus on **understanding**, not just revealing the flag.

---

## ⏳ When Writeups Are Allowed

Writeups may be published only when:

- ✅ The CTF season has officially ended  
- ✅ The challenge is marked as archived  
- ✅ The organizer explicitly allows writeups  

Publishing writeups during an **active season is strictly prohibited**.

---

## ❌ Prohibited Writeup Content

Writeups must **not** include:

- Live or active flags  
- Direct flag values  
- Credentials or secrets  
- Zero-day vulnerabilities  
- Exploits against real-world systems  

Any content that enables **immediate misuse** is not allowed.

---

## 🧠 Responsible Disclosure

If a writeup reveals:
- An unintended vulnerability  
- A platform bug  
- An infrastructure issue  

Report it privately to the GoPwnIt team instead of publishing it publicly.
