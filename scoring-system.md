The scoring system is designed to be:
- Fair  
- Transparent  
- Competitive

## 🎯 Challenge Points

- Category complexity  
- Expected time to solve  

### Typical Difficulty Levels
- 🟢 Easy

Higher difficulty challenges award **more points**.

## 📈 Dynamic Scoring (If Enabled)

Some seasons may use **dynamic scoring**, where:

Dynamic scoring rules are defined per season.

## 🏁 Flag Submission & Validation

- A correct flag submission awards points instantly

## 🧮 Team Scoring

For team-based seasons:
- Points earned by any team member contribute to the **team score**

- Individual stats may still be visible for reference  

Team rules are season-specific.

## 🏆 Leaderboard Rankings

Leaderboards rank participants based on:
1. Total points earned  
2. Number of challenges solved  
3. Submission time (tie-breaker, if applicable)  

Leaderboards update **in real time** during active seasons.

They may be:

## 🚫 Penalties & Adjustments

GoPwnIt reserves the right to:
